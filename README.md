## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

- How to set the image according to background in mobile view.
- I learned that how can I change the color of an image or fill different color in the image.

```css
img {
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
  object-fit: contain;
}
img {
  mix-blend-mode: multiply;
  filter: opacity(75%);
}
```

### Continued development

From this project I learned that I have to work more upon CSS properties for filter, blend and opacity. Also on the resizing of the image in mobile UI.
